Creation of the profile
Add session counting points and repetitions

At first it will only be a Java project with no GUI

The Body is an object that can be modified after logging a session. 
Size and Level are also objects that defines the Body.

When you log a session, you can enter the numer of repetition on a machine with the weight lifted.
Machines have to be described (interface ? class ?  just attribute of the upLevel or downLevel ?)
Example : push-ups is for upLevel so in the upLevel object, there will have to be a push-up
